About mailmaster.pro

MailMaster.Pro is aimed at providing tailored e-mail server setup, hosting and management services to businesses/professionals worldwide in need for secure, scalable and easy-to-use electronic communication solution with good global reputation score allowing them to reach their partners and customers with confidence.

Our services are implemented exclusively by using industry best practices and quality open source components that are trusted by millions of users worldwide.

Small and medium size entities often lack in-house technical resources and IT staff to configure and run their own email server properly, maintain top scores in global spam filters, and counter the continuous attempts by spammers to infiltrate your inbound and outbound communication channels. Hiring your own System Administrator to upkeep your email server would be an overkill for most use cases. Using our services is as close to having them in-house as possible.

We appreciate the highly sensitive nature of email correspondence data and the importance of maintaining it's security and confidentiality. If you choose our email server management services, your data will be handled in strict confidence. Please contact us to discuss any concerns or additional non-disclosure assurances.
